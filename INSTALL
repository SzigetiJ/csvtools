INSTALLATION GUIDE
==================

Quick guide
-----------

Run bootstrap scripts:
 libtoolize; aclocal; automake --add-missing; autoconf

Run conventional build/install scripts:
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

Detailed guide
--------------

0.) Bootstrapping

Repository does not contain generated files (e.g., configure script,
Makefile, etc.). The only hand-written files that control the build and
install process are configure.ac and Makefile.am. The bootstrap script
are responsible for generating the files required by configure/make build
process.

I.) configure

Configuration can be customized with environment variables or with
configuration options.

By setting CXXFLAGS we can override compilation with debug information
(with or without -g flag), we can set optimization level (-O0 .. -O3),
etc.

To display the complete list of available options run

 ./configure --help

Example #1:

If we want to build only dynamic libraries without debug information at
optimization level 3 and to install them into a given location:

 CXXFLAGS="-O3 -W -Wall" ./configure --disable-static --prefix=/home/user1/local


II.) make

With the make command we can compile the source and link the object files. The inverted command of make is

 make clean

which removes build executables, libs and object files. By invoking

 make distclean

we can also remove files created by the configure script.


III.) make install

The default prefix is /usr/local. Copying files into /usr/local usually
requires root privileges. If we set prefix to a location where we have
write permission, we do not have to sudo the command.

Inverted command of make install is

 make uninstall

which removes installed binaries, libs and headers.
